<p><i>If we tried to think of a good idea, we wouldn’t have been able to think of a good idea. You just have to find the solution for a problem in your own life.</i> I am fascinated by the process of architecting software applications. I believe in every software you make, there needs to be a better architecture. You’re most likely to be productive when you’re trying to make the code as separate and clean as possible. Problem-Solving is what I am passionate about. It gives me immense pleasure to work in teams and seize the opportunity to mentor and be mentored. In the past, I have worked on projects in various capacities like Data Mining, Information Retrieval and Web Services. Throughout this journey, I got exposed to technologies like Apache Spark, Scala, Kafka, Python, and Java. </p>



<p>I aspire to become an <i>Entrepreneur</i> and build something that can change the world. This is my way of giving it back to the society. I will soon be joining VMware as a Software Engineer. With all the experience I acquire, I look forward to creating an impact.</p>
