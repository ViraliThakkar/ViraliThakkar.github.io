<p>Today, I stand at the intersection of <i>Software Development and Data Engineering</i>. I am fascinated by Data Ingestion, Distributed File Systems, Batch and Real Time Processing. I consider technologies like Kafka, Apache Spark and Scala as my Superpowers. Processing and storing data consistently and efficiently across a distributed cluster of dozens (or hundreds) of servers. Ingesting complex, semi-structured data from a variety of real-world sources that dynamically evolve. Monitoring systems in real-time to automate decisions within milliseconds of incoming events. I have been exploring these problems and learning a lot through the experience.</p>

<p>Besides this, I am a <i>Motivator</i> who loves to pump up everyone around me. I believe that teaching someone is the best way to learn. I love to teach. Exchange of knowledge can take you places. I love the ideology that one can ‘change’ things for the good. At the end, you must use your knowledge to make world a better place.  Also, I am in constant search for hobbies. Stand-up Comedy is something I aspire to commence. I love writing funny short poems! That’s me!</p>
